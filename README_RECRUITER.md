# Computer Graphics – 3D Scene Project

## Overview  
This project is a 3D scene built using OpenGL and C++, as part of a Computational Graphics & Visualization course.  
The scene models a small room containing a wooden table, stools, a ceramic cup, and a chandelier, with textured walls, interactive lighting, and camera navigation.

## Technologies  
- C++  
- OpenGL  
- GLSL Shaders (vertex + fragment)  
- Visual Studio (or your chosen IDE)  
- 3D math (transformations, lighting / shading, texture mapping)

## My Contributions & Highlights  
- Implemented object transformations, texture mapping, and material properties (wood, ceramic, etc.) to make the scene visually realistic.  
- Developed a basic Phong lighting model (ambient, diffuse, specular) and applied it to multiple objects with different surface properties.  
- Added user-controlled camera navigation (keyboard + mouse) to allow exploring the scene from various angles.  
- Designed shaders and shader manager for loading, compiling, and applying textures and materials.  
- Created design documentation that explains my choices for object placement, lighting setup, texture sources, and scene composition.

## What Recruiters Should Notice  
- Strong understanding of graphics pipeline: shaders, transformations, lighting, materials.  
- Ability to handle both the math/theory and the implementation side of computer graphics.  
- Clean code structure: separating rendering, management of objects/materials, shader logic.  
- Experience with real-time rendering and interactive camera / user input — foundations important for game engines, visualization tools, VR/AR, etc.

## How to Run / Explore  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the Visual Studio solution under `3dScene/`.  
3. Build the project.  
4. Run the executable from `Executable/`.  
5. Use mouse + keyboard to navigate through the scene.  
6. Optional: explore the source code files for shader logic, texture loading, and material properties.

## Optional Notes  
- The design document **DesignDecisions.pdf** captures architectural and visual design choices (object shapes, lighting, materials).  
- Screenshots in the `Screenshots/` folder show the final rendered scene from multiple angles.  
- Project serves as one of my strongest graphics samples; highlights ability to work on visual and performance aspects.
